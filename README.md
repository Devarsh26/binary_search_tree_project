# Data Structure for Admin of Telephone Company


## About

The project in this repository implements a system for an Admin working at a telephone service company.

- #### Problem Statement: 

  The system should enable the admin to add new customers and to figure out the customers who are low on balance so that they can inform them.

- #### Data Structure: 

     Binary Search Tree: BST is chosen over normal binary tree since In-order traversal is not possible in a normal Binary Tree.


- #### Solution:
  A Menu driven program which helps the admin perform certain functions like 

  Adding a customer -- INSERTION

  View the list of customers -- IN ORDER TRAVERSAL

  Find the customer with Minimum and Maximum Balance -- MINNODE, MAXNODE

  Find customers within a given range of Balance to find out the low/high balance customers -- PRINTRANGE
